            <h3>In a nutshell</h3>
          </div>

          <p class="text-lg-left text-md-left">
            My experience as an intern at Elewana's Loisaba Tented Camp has been one riddled with unexpected but pleasant twists in my expectations. I have learned a lot of
            invaluable lessons that have pushed me to become better in various skills including but not limited to communication and observation. The one lesson that I personally
            believe has had the most impact in my life thus far is to put myself out there and not be afraid to make mistakes as that is the fastest way to learn. Sure, this is
            something you are encouraged to do everyday, but this has been particularly difficult for me as I am somewhat of a perfectionist and I have to make sure that whatever
            I'm doing is bound to succeed. But with the overwhelming support I received from the staff, which frankly I did not expect at first, I was able to push past this block
            and the results were more than pleasant. This segues nicely into my second point, because in order to have things run smoothly, my observation skills had to be 
            sharpened and sharpened they have been. I find it much easier to ask questions without feeling like I'm being a burden to someone and paired with the ability to
            observe more keenly waht is going on in my surroundings, learning has become much faster and holds even more appeal than it did before. I have also learned how to
            avoid judging others based on my standards, which can sometime be too high, even for me to keep. This has in the past led me to dismiss people and or experiences
            based off of what I know and completely ignoring, unintentionally, the perspectives of others. Overall, this is an experience I would not trade for most others.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg-left text-md-center">
            Even with the overwhelmingly positive experience that I had, there are some things that I believe I could brush up on that I believe have held me back from reaching
            the full height of my potential, the main being, as I've mentioned before, the fact that once I have made up my mind about how certain things, it takes quite a good
            amount of convincing to change my views on it. My only saving grace I would say is the fact that I am very open to new perspectives and as long as it isn't something
            that would compromise my ethical code, there is a good chance I will adapt to the feedback. I have also realised that I have a problem with excecuting tasks that seem
            redundunt, which is a major disadvantage concidering this might have to be the case in most situations. I am still looking for a way to work around this pet peeve,
            but I concider it a win that I'm aware of it.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg-left text-md-center">
            Finally, my advice to any student who plans to work anywhere, as an intern or otherwhise, is that you should take everything that comes your way with an equal measure
            of enthusiasm, no matter how pointless it might seem. This means that whether you're assigned to work at that corner office or you're given a broom to mop the floor,
            do it with all you've got. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't set your goals high, it just means that you never know where that opportunity to get to your goals will
            come from. It is also a great way to learn more about something that you might never have had the chance to learn. As a personal testimony, I can attribute my personal
            success in this internship to the fact that I was always open to helping out wherever I can, provided it didn't collide with the personal duties I had to fulfill. A large
            part of being a leader is being able to earn the respect of those you work with, regardless of what their paycheck or status. Many a times, some of the most valuable lessons
            you learn come from the least expected places. One final piece of advice, smile and say hi. It goes a long way.
