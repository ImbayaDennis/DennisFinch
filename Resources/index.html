                Hi there! Dennis here. You're probaplly wondering to yourself, "Who in their right
                mind starts an about section like this!?" but I've come to terms with the fact that
                I'm special like that. If you've guessed by now that I probably don't spend
                enough time around people, you're right. I prefer to stare at my screen and come
                up with something that I, and hopefully others, can consider creative. So naturally
                I would go for computer science as my major, in one of the coolest Universities in
                the world I might add. But that's totally subjective. Whenever I'm not getting frustrated
                trying to get my code to work, I'm getting frustrated trying to finish that music track
                I started about a month ago. Yep. That's right. I make music. And I LOVE it. I don't
                care what anyone says, music is a universal language of the soul. Whoever thinks otherwise
                deserves nothing less than the Guillotine. Just Kidding. Not really.

                                The journey to securing my current internship was as interesting as they
                                get. It was completely unexpected to say the least and my experience upto
                                this point has been one pleasant twist in expectations after another.The
                                journey began as soon as the second I completed my first internship. I had
                                failed to qualify for career development placement so I had to self-source.

                    My experience as an intern at Elewana's Loisaba Tented Camp has been one riddled with unexpected but pleasant twists in my expectations. I have learned a lot of
                    invaluable lessons that have pushed me to become better in various skills including but not limited to communication and observation. The one lesson that I personally
                    believe has had the most impact in my life thus far is to put myself out there and not be afraid to make mistakes as that is the fastest way to learn. Sure, this is
                    something you are encouraged to do everyday, but this has been particularly difficult for me as I am somewhat of a perfectionist and I have to make sure that whatever
                    I'm doing is bound to succeed. But with the overwhelming support I received from the staff, which frankly I did not expect at first, I was able to push past this block
                    and the results were more than pleasant.
