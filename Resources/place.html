              <h3>The journey here...</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="text-md-center text-lg-left">
            <div class="container">
              <p>
                  The journey to securing my current internship was as interesting as theyget. It was completely unexpected to say the least and my
                  experience upto this point has been one pleasant twist in expectations after another. The journey began as soon as the second I
                  completed my first internship. I had failed to qualify for career development placement so I had to self-source. My first placement
                  was with a telecommunication company in Kenya that goes by Broadcast Solutions Intrnational. I had just completed my leadership core
                  and seeing as to the fact that I barely had any technical skills, it was extreemly difficult to find a department where I could
                  put my newly gained skills to the test. Finally, I settled on helping the technical team write reports and researching and comparing
                  products for our clients. 
              </p>

              <p>
                For the second time around, I decided that I was going to be more deliberate about my placement, so I first ensured that I secured a 
                spot with the career development department, just so that I could have more options when it came time to decide where I would do my
                internship. I also updated my resume and sent it to a number of companies including Microsoft, Spotify, Sony amoung others. Most of the
                positions I was applying for I admit had quite high qualification barriers but you never know right? Out of all the companies I contacted,
                three responded showing interest in my skillset; ROCKET, ALX, and Elewana Collection. I tried to contact ROCKET but I don't recall receiving
                A response. As for ALX, I was unable to go through with the next level of the recruitment as I was required to complete a number of assignments,
                all of which were due during a time when I was flooded with other commitments. I decided that it would be wiser to drop out of it rather than
                do a half decent job which I would nit find satisfactory.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then came the response from Elewana, mentioning that they had been impressed by my application and wanted to call for my first interview.
                I was extatic and nervous at the same time. I wasn't sure I would be able to handle all my engagements and have time to prepare for the
                interview but none the less I put my best foot forward and went through with it. The first interview was a disaster, in my eyes at least. I
                could literally feel myself fumbling for answers that you would think were simple had I done enough research. I remember turning to my
                roommate at the time and telling him what a disaster it was right after I had ended the interview call. Apparently I was being too hard on
                myself because a few days later, I received an email congratulating me for securing my spot for a second interview.
              </p>

              <p>
                At this point, it's safe to say that I believed in miracles. The second interview went quite smoothly and I could tell from the interviewer's
                tone of voice, that she had made up her mind on who she would pick for the part. This lifted a huge load off my shoulders as it meant I wouldn't
                have to go through as many obstacles as I did the first time around. All in all, I learned that sometimes our expectations of ourselves can hold
                us back from doing things that seem impossible, but it's always good to remember just how much we're capable of.

                <p>Sprawling over the rolling plains north of Mt Kenya, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is a prolific wildlife conservancy that is popular with celebrities, conservationists, writers and photographers. Lewa found recent media attention with stories of a Royal romance and the fairytale engagement that followed.</p>
                <p>Visitors to Lewa are privy to some of the most spectacular wildlife viewing that Kenya has to offer: lion, leopard and jackal thrive on the rich diversity of prey that inhabits the area. The Wildlife Conservancy is home to the largest concentration of Grevy’s zebra in the world, and its range of habitats attracts diverse birdlife and hosts over 130 Black and White rhino.</p>
                <p>Featuring large tented bedrooms with verandahs and full en-suite bathrooms, Lewa Safari camp offers authentic comfort for its visitors; cozy log fires in the sitting room are perfect for relaxing after a day in the Conservancy. This unique and exclusive retreat offers privileged access to 65,000 acres of private protected wilderness.</p>
                <p>Underpinning the glamorous magnetism of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy is a serious mission: a pioneering and pragmatic approach to conservation, founded in the 1970’s, that has developed into a thriving and globally recognised rhino conservation habitat.</p>
                <p>Lewa Safari Camp is the only tourist facility within the Conservancy that is owned by the Conservancy. Profits and conservancy fees generated by the camp are reinvested directly into the conservation and community efforts of Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.</p>

                <p>The rugged and remote Meru National Park was rescued from oblivion thanks to Elsa’s Kopje, an environmental award-winning, boutique lodge. Winner of the Good Safari Guide’s ‘Best Safari Property in Africa’ award, Elsa’s Kopje is widely renowned as one of the most elegant lodges in Africa.</p>
                <p>Elsa’s Kopje was designed and built by Stefano Cheli, officially opened by Dr. Richard Leakey (Director of Kenya Wildlife Service at the time), and Virginia McKenna of Born Free fame in 1999.  One of the most beautiful parks in Kenya, Liz & Stefano included Meru National Park on most of their mobile tented safaris.</p>

                <p>Tortilis Camp was one of the first eco-lodges of its size, and is very proudly 100% solar. Guests can rest assure they are leaving a minimal footprint during their stay.</p>

              <h3>Afrochic Diani Beach</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Some destinations are timeless; others are often well kept secrets. Lying south of Mombasa, Kenya, on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, Afrochic Diani is the perfect getaway for the discerning traveller who wants to simply ‘flop and drop’ and enjoy the spectacular views of exotic and ancient dhows in full sail.</p>
                <p>This exclusively intimate hotel - with only 10 guest rooms each with their own en suite bathroom, balcony and sun-loungers - is singularly personable and highly individual.</p>
                <p>In these days of large inventory beach hotels, Afrochic’s unique and eclectic style of interiors and designs makes a refreshing change from the standard alternatives.</p>
                <p>From the moment you walk through the doors, you will be embraced by the understanding of what has made AfroChic the ‘sought-after’ destination for those seeking rest, relaxation and the personal touch.</p>
                <p>Friendly and attentive staff are on hand to provide those little but special details that have become synonymous with an Elewana Collection property.</p>
                <p>Miles of expansive and near deserted beaches await discovery, and for those who wish a more active way to spend the day, an 18 hole Championship Golf Course is within three minutes drive from the hotel. Local boutiques, spas, and craft markets are a short ride away, and day trips to Shimba Hills Reserve and Mwaluganje Elephant Sanctuary add to the Kenyan coastal experience.</p>
                <p>AfroChic is certainly one of Africa’s best kept secrets. It is a marriage of romance, African style and all that is best in East African hospitality. AfroChic is certainly a jewel in the Elewana Collection, and one that continues to shine brighter than ever.</p>

              <h3>Tarangire Treetops</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Many a childhood would have been spent playing in the world of ‘make-believe’. Within this imaginary existence many of us will have climbed and played high up in the bows and branches and, for the lucky few, built a ‘palace’ in the sky.</p>
                <p>It is this nostalgic sparkle that is all too visible in the eyes of the ‘grown-ups’ who gaze upon Tarangire Treetops for the first time. Tarangire Treetops sits serenely on the border of the Tarangire National Park - Tanzania.</p>
                <p>As you arrive at the Lodge, you are immediately greeted by a blaze of colour and a host of smiles all of which belong to the local Maasai tribesmen who have become part of the enchanting story that is Tarangire Treetops.</p>
                <p>Centered about a Main Lodge - which itself encases a thousand year-old baobab tree - Tarangire Treetops comprises of 20 rooms all of which are elevated above the ground affording views over the tops of surrounding marula and baobab trees.</p>
                <p>Each Treetops Room boasts one of the largest bedrooms to be found in any camp or lodge in East Africa – with a floor space of 65 square metres – and all with an exotic double shower en suite bathroom. With furnishings that create warmth and demonstrate a commitment to local craftsmanship, the ‘up-in-the-air’ experience is completed by the open-fronted room design affording views across the Tarangire plains from an expansive but private balcony.</p>
                <p>Dining at Treetops sustains the momentum of undeniably memorable moments. Whether enjoying a lantern-lit dinner in a traditional Boma echoing to the sounds of Maasai chants, or eating poolside by candlelight whilst a wealth of wildlife comes to drink at the Lodge water hole, Treetops creates memories by the minute and in so many differing ways.</p>
                <p>However it is the pure delight and sheer pleasure of Tarangire Treetops that will remain with you for years to come, and will keep you returning, if only in spirit, to this delightfully dreamlike lodge.</p>

              <h3>The Manor at Ngorongoro</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Crossing the Rift Valley and climbing the steppe onto the green and rolling hills south of the Ngorongoro Crater, there lies a truly undeniable surprise and one that will be a home-away-from-home.</p>
                <p>The Manor at Ngorongoro, located in the north west Tanzania and with its 9 luxurious cottages (18 Suites), family cottage, and magnificent main Manor House, is one of the first safari lodges of its kind to blend East African hospitality with old-world Afro-European architecture and decor. Located adjacent to the famous Ngorongoro conservation area and within a 1500-acre Arabica coffee estate, The Manor is reminiscent of an elegant up-country farm home in the Cape Dutch-style of architecture.</p>
                <p>Every detail of The Manor has been designed with its guests’ comfort in mind. Each of the cottages has been carefully positioned to maximise the views of the adjacent verdant hills but at the same time to maintain the intimacy and privacy of this old-world Manor home.</p>
                <p>The Manor at Ngorongoro provides the perfect environment to relax and take in the outstanding natural beauty of its gardens and the coffee-bush laden hills. However the drama that is Africa is but a short distance away.</p>
                <p>Ngorongoro Crater is famed as being the ‘Eighth Wonder of the World’, and is a ‘must see’ on anyone’s itinerary. This extinct volcano - with its 18-kilometre wide crater floor - is home to an abundant and unique ecosystem that encompasses almost all of the wildlife that you would wish to see in Africa. This spectacular setting is a ‘once-in-a- lifetime’ opportunity to experience the rawness and beauty of Africa’s natural flora and fauna.</p>
                <p>And what better way to enjoy the Crater than in the knowledge that at the end of the day you will return to enjoy an incomparable dinner in The Manor’s restaurant followed by a deeply restful night in a cottage that has been designed both with your comfort solely in mind.</p>

              <h3>Serengeti Pioneer Camp</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Located in South Central Serengeti - Tanzania - (within the Moru Kopjes area), Serengeti Pioneer Camp is ideally situated to offer superlative access to the annual migration and the ‘Big 5’ with sweeping views overlooking Moru Kopjes, Lake Magadi and the endless plains.</p>
                <p>Each of Elewana Collection’s camps and lodges has its own individual style and feel. Serengeti Pioneer Camp continues this tradition. Paying homage to the mobile camps of the 1930’s, a time when an African safari was truly a journey into the unknown, Serengeti Pioneer Camp’s  ‘zero footprint’ and close proximity to nature combines to make an unmistakably distinctive and truly individual offering.</p>
                <p>Comprising of twelve-tented accommodations, all of which have en-suite facilities including a flushing toilet, vanity basin, and showers, the tent interiors are designed to evoke the very best of an era long-gone but certainly not forgotten.</p>
                <p>A dining tent hosts the Camp’s guests for both breakfast and dinner, whilst luncheons are taken either in the Camp or in the bush during what will no doubt be yet another enthralling day in the Serengeti.</p>
                <p>Serengeti Pioneer Camp captures the original essence of the mobile African safari, engendering nostalgic wonderment whilst unlocking the adventurous spirit within all of us.The drama and beauty of the Serengeti National Park is indeed awe inspiring.</p>
                <p>With the ‘Big Five’ and the annual migration being the constant highlights of any visit to the Serengeti, the introduction of Serengeti Pioneer Camp will help to sate the desires of even the most expectant of safari travelers.</p>
                <p>The combination of both Serengeti Pioneer Camp and that of the award-winning Serengeti Migration Camp to the north, it will now be possible to cover over 90% of the Serengeti from both of these two camps, thus maximising the game-viewing opportunities, and increasing game-viewing time.</p>

              <h3>Serengeti Migration Camp</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Internationally renowned for the greatest wildlife spectacle on the planet, The Serengeti National Park located in north west Tanzania is the ultimate ‘wildlife show’ on earth. Across the globe authors and filmmakers have come to document the Annual Migration of hundreds of thousands of animals, but there is still only one way to understand and experience the true magnificence of this natural phenomena and that is to be part of it</p>
                <p>Serengeti Migration Camp is the embodiment of the ‘camp’ experience. Located next to the famous Grumeti River which is home to resident hippos that bark and wallow their days away, Serengeti Migration Camp has become synonymous with low-impact high-action game viewing in a landscape that is untouched since the dawn of time.</p>
                <p>Hidden among the rocky outcrops Serengeti Migration Camp is located at the starting point of the Migration. Comprising of 20 luxurious elevated tents, each with spacious and richly furnished bedrooms, Serengeti Migration Camp blends seamlessly into the environment.</p>
                <p>Each of the tents is surrounded by its own 360-degree verandah deck, which in turn creates your very own private sanctuary to enjoy the constant game sightings and the ever-present sounds of the bush.</p>
                <p>The main 'tent' has a split-level lounge, a swimming pool, restaurant and viewing platforms that offer views across the river and the rugged landscape beyond. But it is the drama and proximity of the wild, which takes the experience of this camp to an altogether higher level.</p>
                <p>Whether it is walking safaris with experienced and highly knowledgeable guides or the sensation of being as close to nature’s daily fight for survival, the sensory feast that accompanies any visit to Serengeti Migration Camp will no doubt rival anything experienced before.</p>

              <h3>Kilindi Zanzibar</h3>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Kilindi Zanzibar, comprising of a series of white-domed Pavilion guest rooms all set in 50 acres of lush tropical gardens, is a rarity in the world of luxury boutique hotels. Originally designed for Benny Andersson - one of the members of the 1970's pop group ABBA - Kilindi is a true blend of the very best of diverse cultures to be found in Tanzania and on its adjacent island of Zanzibar.</p>
                <p>Kilindi achieves the perfect marriage between Scandinavian minimalism and the dramatic architectural overtones of Middle Eastern heritage, whilst encouraging an open, 'back-to-nature' ambiance throughout.                </p>
                <p>In each of the Pavilion suites, white wooden-slatted shutters embrace wide-arched glassless windows each affording spectacular views over the Indian Ocean. This same openness allows the gentle ocean breeze to waft throughout each of the rooms and carry with it the delightful soundtrack of Kilindi's colourful birdlife. Any stay at Kilindi will be a delight for the senses. </p>
                <p>Kilindi's 'open-to-nature' approach provides the true essence to any stay and crafts a private, intimate and 'barefoot' appeal that so many crave. If you love nature, you will adore Kilindi.</p>
                <p>A 'waterfall' bar with the Main Pavilion overlooks a large 25-metre infinity pool which itself affords views out across the sparkling warm waters of the Indian Ocean. Dining takes place either on the alfresco terrace or even along the pristine white beach, which runs the length of the property.</p>
                <p>15 eastern-styled domed Pavilions nestling amongst a 35-acre tropical garden are the perfect and intimate retreat for each and every guest.</p>
                <p>The Pavilions have their very own private plunge pool, and possess a separate but extraordinary 'rainfall' shower room which is annexed to each of the Pavilion rooms. These same showers provide not only a spectacular view to the Ocean but the liberating sensation of being 'at one with nature'. </p>
                <p>With each Pavilion set in its own private tropical gardens and served by a dedicated butler, privacy is guaranteed. It is this same dedicated butler who will offer you a wide selection of places to enjoy your breakfast, lunch and dinner. And should our guests wish to leave the oasis of tranquility and calm of their private Pavilion, the butler can help, advise and arrange as to the many activities and excursions that Kilindi and the island can offer.</p>
                <p>Kilindi Zanzibar is certainly a rarity and one that will reward all those who venture to experience all that it has to offer. A favourite with honeymooners and lovers, any stay at Kilindi will become both the memory of a lifetime, but the standard to surpass.</p>
